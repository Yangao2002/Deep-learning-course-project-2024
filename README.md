## Deep-learning-course-project-2024

This project focuses on detecting and diagnosing various lung and colon cancers. I implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and applied optimization techniques to improve model.


### Methods
- **Deep learning architecture**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Regularization techniques**: L2 regularization, Dropout
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Learning rate adjustment, layer size optimization
- **Feature engineering**: Reduction of convolutional filters and dense layer neurons
